## Intro about the Game
Game Chrome incident refers to a series of incidents involving the use of Google Chrome browser.These incidents include security vulnerabilities,data leakage,and other issues.Here are some introductions:First of all,Google Chrome is one of the most popular browsers in the world.It is widely used because of its fast speed,stable performance,rich features and strong security.However,due to the complexity of browser software,there are still some security issues and incidents.For example,in 1998,a security vulnerability was found in Chrome,which can be used to perform remote code execution attacks.Google has responded to this vulnerability and released a security patch in time.In addition to security problems,Chrome has also been involved in data leak incidents,such as the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.This incident involves the leak of personal information of 87 million users of Facebook,including name,email address,birthday,city,profile picture,etc.Although Google is not directly related to these incidents and has taken measures to protect user data,these incidents have once again aroused people's attention to browser security and data privacy issues,making Chrome users to re-examine their trust in this browser, and also prompted browser manufacturers to strengthen security protection and privacy protection.

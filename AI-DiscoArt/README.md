ðŸ’¯ **Best-in-class**: industry-level engineering, top-notch code quality, lean dependencies, small RAM/VRAM footprint; important bug fixes, feature improvements [vs. the original DD5.6](FEATURES.md). 

ðŸ‘¼ **Available to all**: smooth install for *self-hosting*, Google Colab *free tier*, non-GUI (IPython) environment, and CLI! No brainfuck, no dependency hell, no stackoverflow. 

ðŸŽ¨ **Focus on create not code**: one-liner `create()` with a Pythonic interface, autocompletion in IDE, and powerful features. Fetch real-time results anywhere anytime, no more worry on session outrage on Google Colab. Set initial state easily for more efficient parameter exploration.
